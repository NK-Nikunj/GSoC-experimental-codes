# This experiment is for Powerpc Platform

To run the experiment, simply run the make file.

```
$ make
```

If build correctly, it should generate an executable `main`. Run the executable.

```
$ ./main
```

If the output turns out to be:

```
$ ./main
initialize_main
main
```

then things are working correctly on Powerpc. Else, I need to delve deeper to understand why it's failing.
